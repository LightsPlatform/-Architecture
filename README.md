# Main Idea of Lights platform
**Brief overview on the architecture of the Lights platform.**

## Introduction
Developing the IoT systems faces many challenges. one of them is the need of developing software part independent of the hardware. on the other hand, the IoT applications must pass some tests that are not possible in the absence of the hardware (eg. Load Test).
The solution is simulating and the  **L**ights **i**s a **g**ood **h**ipper Io**T** **s**imulation platform.
