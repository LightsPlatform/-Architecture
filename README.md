# Main Idea of Lights platform
**Brief overview on the architecture of the Lights platform.**

## Introduction
Developing the IoT systems faces many challenges. one of them is the need of developing software part independent of the hardware. on the other hand, the IoT applications must pass some tests that are not possible in the absence of the hardware (eg. Load Test).
The solution is simulating and the  **L**ights **i**s a **g**ood **h**ipper Io**T** **s**imulation platform.
Lights act as hardware part of an IoT system, it generates data like a virtual sensor, collect data like a virtual broker and do act like a virtual actuator so you can create **vSensor**, **vBroker**, and **vActuator**. just add and configure them, you'll have virtual IoT hardware environment.
